# sample_projects
Projects I have worked on with others either for class or for fun.

These projects will have runner classes that are ran through Linux console.
My recommendation is Minesweeper and tic-tac-toe along with GAAssignment. These programs will have AI that:
1. Solves the board of Minesweeper
2. Tic-tac-toe you are up against the unbeatable AI!
3. GA represents the use of a genetic algorithm to search for a given target represented in binary.
